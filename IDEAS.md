# Ideas

A bunch of random ideas about how to structure the code.

## General

- Each submodule could have a plugin that loads all related stuff (e.g. spawning), or it could be done in a single system in the main module.
  - if it is done in the main module, there could be functions in the submodule that ie create a new sprite
